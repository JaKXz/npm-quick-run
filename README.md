## Install

Install as a global tool `npm install -g npm-quick-run`. This creates two aliases `nrun` and `nr`

## Use inside your module's folder

For example if you have the following scripts in your `package.json`

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "...",
  "lint": "..."
}
```

You can quickly run tests using `nr t` and run the linter using `nr l`, assuming there are
no other script names starting with `t` or `l`. If there are, just be more specific and provide
more unique prefix.
